## 📄 Project Overview
This project analyzes student feedback from college events to identify areas of high satisfaction and opportunities for improvement. The analysis leverages Python libraries such as **pandas**, **seaborn**, and **TextBlob** in **Google Colab**. The dataset (`student_feedback.csv`) contains both numeric ratings and optional text comments collected via Google Forms.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and prepare feedback data.
- Compute and visualize satisfaction ratings (1–10 scale).
- Identify top and bottom performing aspects of college events.
- Analyze correlations between different feedback categories.
- (Optional) Perform sentiment analysis on student comments.
- Generate a mini report summarizing key insights.

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and preparation using **pandas**.
- Statistical summaries and visualization using **seaborn** and **matplotlib**.
- Sentiment analysis using **TextBlob**.
- Report automation and export.

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| Google Colab | Online notebook execution |
| pandas | Data manipulation and cleaning |
| seaborn / matplotlib | Visualization and insights |
| TextBlob | Sentiment analysis (optional) |
| nltk | Text preprocessing |

## 📊 Key Findings (Sample)
- **Overall Average Satisfaction:** 8.12 / 10  
- **Top Rated Aspects:** Course Relevance, Instructor Support, Event Structure  
- **Lowest Rated Aspects:** Feedback Timeliness, Event Scheduling  

## 💡 Insights
- Students are most satisfied with well-structured and relevant events.  
- Scheduling and timely feedback need attention for better overall experience.  
- Maintaining excellence in top-rated areas can sustain student engagement.
